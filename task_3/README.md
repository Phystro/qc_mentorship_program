# Quantum Circuit Simulator

Implementing a quantum circuit simulator

----

#### Implement a quantum circuit simulator that can perform the following:
 * initialize state
 * read program, and for each gate:
   * calculate matrix operator
   * apply operator (modify state)
 * perform multi-shot measurement of all qubits using weighted random technique
